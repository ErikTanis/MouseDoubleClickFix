# MouseDoubleClickFix

This script fixes the double click glitch on your mouse.
However here are a few sidenotes:
1. The problem is caused by hardware, consider trying to fix it yourself before you use this program.
2. This program only cancels out double clicks. You will probably still experience problems dragging and selecting things. Consider using the windows built-in ClickLock.
3. This program cancels the click when it's detected within 70ms after the previous click. This means you won't be able to click within 70ms yourself as well. Keep this in mind.
